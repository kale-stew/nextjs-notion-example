# Next.js x Notion

This website is a sample newsletter sign-up page that incorporates a backend hosted in a [Notion](https://notion.so) database with a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) frontend. It has a page to view all existing users, and a page for new users to sign-up on. The database itself is hosted in Notion, and you can view it in realtime [here](https://www.notion.so/notiondenver/2b41ff18697742c094696d0dda317a23?v=0ed93d3d67eb4de0a4410466fd5ef9eb).

This sample site is deployed using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) but you can substitute this step for a variety of other deployment hosts, including [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) or [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) -- see the [Deployment](#deployment) section below for more information on how to set those alternatives up.

**Why I Made This**

When I first went to integrate my many Notion databases with smaller frontends I had built out for smaller projects, I kept running into the same issue: the Notion API does not allow you to call it from the browser, so it does not work with a "vanilla" React application. You need to implement server-side rendering (a.k.a. SSR) to access the SDK. Next.js is one of the easiest ways to do this.

Notion doesn't and cannot have a no-cors policy as it would open the API up for abuse. Cors access policies exist to limit access to an API, and when that API is exchanging credentials connected to paid accounts, this can get a little too risky.

There are a number of other ways to connect a Notion database with a SPA frontend, but this is the simplest I've found.

## Development

First, you'll need to remove the `.example` extension from the `.env.example` file at the root of this repository. Once this is done, substitute the placeholder text in that file with your unique `NOTION_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`. If you need help finding these values within your own workspace, follow [these instructions in the Notion API setup docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started).

**Important:** Don't forget to "share" your page in Notion with the integration once you've created it in the Notion UI. I've found that this step is easily overlooked and it will prevent your integration from even seeing the database.

### Adding new Notion queries

In the `src/utils/notion.js` file, you'll see the existing Notion queries. Following the conventions outlined by the [`@notionhq/client` Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notionhq/client), you can implement additional fetches, pull additional fields from the existing queries, or even post data to your database from inputs on your website's frontend.

## Deployment

### via Github Pages

This is the solution I've chosen for this repository. Using [this well-documented](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) Github Action, you can configure Github Pages to deploy your website with every merge to or pull request against the primary branch. See the `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` file to modify your deployment pipeline.

For steps to set up your deploy and runner access tokens, check out the ["Getting Started" steps](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages#getting-started) for this Action.

#### Adding Environment Variables to Github

In the settings for your repository on Github, there is both an "Environments" and a "Secrets" tab. "Environments" refers to @TODO, while "Secrets" are the tokens that "Environments" will use to operate on your repository. When you initialize your gh-pages branch for the first time, a "github-pages" environment will populate this section of your repo settings. In order to deploy your website via gh-pages, you'll need to initialize 3 separate secrets:

1. `GH_TOKEN`
2. `ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`
3. `Public key of ACTIONS_DEPLOY_KEY`

### via Vercel

Vercel makes continuous integration of a Next.js website via [their platform](https://vercel.com/dashboard) very straightforward. You only need to auth the dashboard into your preferred source management account (I choose to auth through Github, but Bitbucket and Gitlab are also options), select the repository you'd like to deploy, and Vercel will take care of the rest. They also make it easy to apply changes to your deployment pipeline via a user-friendly dashboard, including configuring custom domains. It's magical.

### via Netlify

Similar to Vercel, Netlify also offers an integrated deployment setup via their user-friendly dashboard. Just like Vercel, you can [log into their dashboard](https://app.netlify.com), authorize a source management account, select the repo you'd like to integrate, and ðŸŒˆ just like that âœ¨ you've got a continually deployed website.
